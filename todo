am-detect:
	- use a moving average/boxcar average/window for better AM high/low detection

ampm:
	- use scores to estimate noise and/or framing slips?
	- compare phase transitions to expected shapes
	- estimate phase drift over multiple seconds
	- keep track of the decoded time and use it to drive decoding
	- handle >0.1Hz offset frequencies (feedback to center frequency filter?)
	- single bit flip correction in pm code from parity
	- work on better than 1s accuracy via AM and PM transitions

framer2:
	- consider % of time silent instead of run of silence
	- problem: silence or full power spanning multiple local seconds (if the AM levels are wrong)
	- include phase transitions in frame detection?
